The composition of the obtained microorganisms and the closest metagenomic data retrieved from the SRA, ERA and DRA sequence data are displayed as a bar graph. The sample information of the metagenome data retrieved from the SRA, ERA and DRA sequence data that is closest to the obtained microbial composition is displayed."
